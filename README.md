# TROUBLESHOOTING

I haven't found any issues other than the possibility of the UI going off-screen, so just.. don't have a big homework assignment

I have no clue if this works on quizzes or anything else.


## side note

can i point out that, the website legit sends you the answers even if no check answers is active. i lowkey think this will work on like normal tests and quizzes and maybe even actual ap tests

can someone go sacrifice their future to test this out ü•∞
